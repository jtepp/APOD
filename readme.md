<h1>Astronomy Photo of the Day (APOD) - <a href="https://apod-spacestagram.netlify.app/">Link</a></h1>
<p>
    My submission for the Shopify Front End Developer Intern Challenge
</p>

<br>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    APOD is a simple web app that displays a feed of astronomy images from the open <a href="https://api.nasa.gov/">NASA APOD API</a>. APOD is designed to be accessible to all users, with innovative and intuitive features providing a great user experience. The site is coded entirely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is hosted on Netlify. Initially, I implemented most of the page's icons using the <a href="https://www.boxicons.com">Boxicons</a> web-component, though once I wanted more customization, I just took the SVG code from the Box-Icons site and used it within the HTML.
